Since no specific information about Ringo's singing issue is provided, here are some potential reasons why someone may struggle with singing:

* Vocal strain or fatigue
* Breathing difficulties
* Poor posture
* Lack of practice or warm-ups
* Fear or anxiety while singing
* Underlying medical conditions affecting the vocal cords
* Inadequate training or guidance

These are general possibilities, and a more specific response would require more information about Ringo's situation.
